The current healthcare claims system faces delays, fraud, and inefficiency. This project proposes a blockchain-based solution using Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS for secure, transparent, and automated claims processing. It reduces paperwork, enhances trust, prevents fraud, and improves overall efficiency and user experience.
